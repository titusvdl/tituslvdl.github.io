        <h1>Question 1:</h1>
<p> 
    Use PySAL to create a contiguity-based weight matrix (W) for a given spatial dataset of polygons. Write a function create_contiguity_weights that:
    <li>Reads in a shapefile of polygons.</li>
    <li>Constructs a Queen contiguity-based spatial weights matrix.</li>
    <li>Returns the weight matrix.</li>

    <h1>Question 2:</h1>
<p>
    Write a function calculate_morans_i that:
