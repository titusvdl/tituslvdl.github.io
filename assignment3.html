<h1>Exercise 1: Loading the Data</h1>

<p>In this exercise, we will load the <code>goodreads.csv</code> file, explore the data, and rename the columns to specific names.</p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Load the <code>goodreads.csv</code> file into Python using Pandas.</li>
    <li>Explore the dataset by printing the first and last 5 rows.</li>
    <li>Rename the columns of the dataset to:
        <pre><code>["rating", "review_count", "isbn", "booktype", "author_url", "year", "genre_urls", "dir", "rating_count", "name"]</code></pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <pre><code># 1a loading the csv data set into the notebook
import pandas as pd
f = 'data/goodreads.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(f)

# 1b looking at the frist 5 rows of the dataframe
df.head(5)

# 1b looking at the last 5 rows of the dataframe
df.tail(5)

# 1c adding column names to the 'goodreads.csv' dataframe
df.columns = ["rating", 'review_count', 'isbn', 'booktype','author_url', 'year', 'genre_urls', 'dir','rating_count', 'name']

# 1c testing the dataframe to see if the new column names were added correctly 
df.head(5)</code></pre>
</p>

    <h1>Exercise 2: Subsetting the data</h1>

<ul><li>Subset the data by creating new dataframe only with `["rating", 'isbn', 'author_url', 'year', 'genre_urls', 'name']`</li></ul>
    
<h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p><pre><code>
# 2 slicing the pandas dataframe by using the 'loc' or 'iloc' function
# The difference between the loc and iloc functions is that the loc function selects rows using row labels (e.g. tea),
# whereas the iloc function selects rows using their integer positions (staring from 0 and going up by one for each row)
# loc uses the information in the datasets's indices to do its work 
filtered_df = df.loc[0:, ['rating', 'isbn', 'author_url', 'year', 'genre_urls', 'name']]
filtered_df

        # 2 testing the new dataframe to see whether the right columns were transfered out of the original df
filtered_df.head(5)
        </code></pre>
</p>

     <h1>Exercise 3: Manage Missing Data</h1>
<p>Weâ€™ve got a number of ways in general of dealing with missing data. These involve

1. Dropping off cases (or rows) in the data with any missing variables
2. Excluding variables in the data with any missing data 
3. Selectively choosing indicators with only a limited amount of missing data
4. Replacing missing variables with averages, or other representative values
5. Creating a separate model to predict missing data

- Count the missing values in each column
- Manage the missing values (delete or replace values or leave them as they are) and briefly explain your choice for each column</p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p><pre><code>
        # 3a.1 filtered_df has a total of 5998 + 1 rows as shown in exercise 2 
# .count() calcultes the amount of times an 'object' apears in a list (in this case a value)
# so you can subtract the amount of times a value is shown in a row by the total number of rows to find how many rows do NOT have a value (missing values)
5999 - filtered_df.count() 

        # 3a.1 proof that there are 7 missing values in the column 'year' as shown in the outcome of the previous calculation
filtered_df[filtered_df.year.isnull()]

        # 3a.2 can also be done by using .isnull() (to show how many missing values there are) and .sum() to calculate the total per column
filtered_df.isnull().sum()

        #3a.2 which can be writen in a more extensive way as 
missing_values = filtered_df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)

        # 3b we checked the data and there are two rows that all miss data in the columns 'rating', 'author_url', 'name'
# we decided to drop those two rows as there are only 2 of them out of 5999 
# but if wanted you could calculate a mean for the numeric data, by doing:  
# "filtered_df['rating'] = filtered_df['rating'].fillna(filtered_df['rating'].mean())"

filtered_df = filtered_df.dropna(subset=['rating'])

# for the column 'isbn' there are 477 missing values, but can be left as is:
# we don't want to alter the data and mess up the curent integers in the column, if needed for further research

# for the column 'year' there are 7 missing values, but can be left as is:
# there are only 7 rows out of 5997, so the missing values won't be that significant, 
# but the rest of the values in that row might be, hence we leave them in 

# for the column 'genre_url' there are 62 missing values, but can be left as is:
# as they make up 1% of the total data set, so the missing values won't be that significant
# but the rest of the values in that row might be, hence we leave them in 

        # 3b test to see if there are any rows left without value for the column 'rating'
filtered_df.loc[filtered_df.rating.isnull()]

        # 3b test to see only two rows were deleted out of the filtered_df dataframe
filtered_df
