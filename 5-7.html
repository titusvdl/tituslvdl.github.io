Question 1
Use PySAL to create a contiguity-based weight matrix (W) for a given spatial dataset of polygons. Write a function create_contiguity_weights that:

    Reads in a shapefile of polygons.
    Constructs a Queen contiguity-based spatial weights matrix.
    Returns the weight matrix.

# creating a queen contiguity based spatial weight matrix to test whether neigbourhoods are adjacent
# with the queen contiguity based spatial weight matrix iyou can test wether these observations (neighbourhoods) share a vortex
# vortex = (a single point)
w_queen = weights.Queen.from_dataframe(gdf, ids='gebied_naam')
w_queen

# opening the geodataframe to find the name (row) of one of the districts (gebieds_naam, column)
gdf

# testing wether the queen contiguity based spatial weight matrix worked for on of the districts
w_queen['Diamantbuurt']

# writing a function "reate_contiguity_weigh" that includes all the previous steps 
# to succesfully create create a contiguity-based weight matrix (W) for a given spatial dataset of polygons
# that aslo returns the weight matrix ("return" is something you can only do with a function)
def create_contiguity_weights(geodataframe):
    gdf = gpd.read_file(geodataframe)
    w_queen = weights.Queen.from_dataframe(gdf, ids='gebied_naam')
    return w_queen





Question 2
Write a function calculate_morans_i that:

    Takes a spatial weight matrix W and an attribute array y.
    Calculates Moran’s I for the given attribute array.
    Returns the Moran’s I value and its p-value.


from esda.moran import Moran
#First we must define the geodatabase, it was defined earlier in the previous function but this function
#cannot look inside the other so we must define it again
gdf = gpd.read_file(geodataframe)

#We create a function called calculate_morans_i which takes the contiguity matrix
#from exercise 1 and calculates morans i with it
def calculate_morans_i(w_queen):
    
    #First the function standardizes the rows
    w_queen.transform = 'r'

    # Then it defines Y as a row from the dataframe
    Y = gdf['opp_gebied_ha'].values

    # We then use the moran function to calculate morans I with 
    #the information from Y and the weighted matirx W
    moran = Moran(Y, w_queen)
   
    #The function then retunr Morans I
    return moran

#We first define moran
moran = calculate_morans_i(w_queen)

#Which then allows the print functions to actually print Morans I and the P value
print(f"Moran's I: {moran.I}")
print(f"P-value: {moran.p_sim}")

#Made by Marco


Question 3
Create a function standardize_weights that:

    Takes a spatial weight matrix W.
    Standardizes it so that the weights of each row sum to one.
    Returns the standardized weight matrix.


# create a function "standardize_weights" with the spatial weight matrix(w_queen) as a parameter 
# parameters in functions act as place holders, it specifies what kind of input the function expects
# an argument is the actual value you pass into the function when you call it, substituting the parameter
# in this case w_queen is the variable that holds the spatial weight matrix
# the following function standardizes this w_quuen matrix by using .transform 
# in this case row-based transformation is needed, to make sure every row of the matrix sums up to one
# 'R' stands for row-standardization
from libpysal import weights

def standardize_weights(w_queen):
    w_queen.transform = 'R'
    return w_queen


# w_queen is the spatial weights matrix
# you can check the standardized values by printing .... 
w_standardized = standardize_weights(w_queen)
print(w_standardized['Diamantbuurt'])




Question 4
Write a function create_distance_weights that:

    Takes a set of point coordinates and a threshold distance.
    Constructs a distance-based spatial weight matrix where all points within the threshold distance are assigned a weight.
    Returns the weight matrix.



Question 5
Using PySAL, write a function plot_moran that:

    Takes a spatial weights matrix W and an attribute array y.
    Creates and displays a Moran plot for the attribute.
    Saves the Moran plot as an image file.
