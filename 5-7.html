Exercise 5: Saving the results
 - Save the cleaned dataframe as 'hw-03-cleaned.csv' in data folder

Code
# 5 saving the dataframe as csv
# 'data/hw-03-cleaned.csv' specifies the path where the file will be saved 
# 'index=False' prevents pandas from writing row indicies to the csv file  

filtered_df.to_csv('data/hw-03-cleaned.csv', index=False)
Code


## Exercise 6: Investigate the relationship between the number of reviews and the average rating for books in the dataset cleaned-goodreads.csv procided.

  - Calculate the correlation coefficient. Give me a short definition of this coefficient
  - Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between these two features.
  - Based on the plot and the correlation, provide a brief interpretation of the relationship.

### Python Tools: Use pandas and numpy for correlation, and matplotlib or seaborn for the scatter plot.

Code
# 6a loading the csv data set into the notebook
import pandas as pd
f = 'data/cleaned-goodreads.csv'
df2 = pd.read_csv(f)
df2.head(5)

# 6a calculating the correlation coefficient between the column 'review_count' and 'rating'
# the .corr() function in pandas is used to calculate the correlation coefficient 
# df2['review_count'] accesses the column with the total number of reviews for each book 
# df2['rating'] accesses the column with the average rating for each book
# the .corr() function is aplied to the column "df2['review_count']"
# the second column is the argument to compare the first column with .corr(df2['rating'])
# a f-string was used to increase readability 

correlation_coefficient = df2['review_count'].corr(df2['rating'])
print(f"Correlation coefficient between the columns 'review_count' and 'rating': {correlation_coefficient}")

# If the correlation coefficient is close to +1: It indicates that books with more reviews tend to have higher ratings
# If it is close to -1: It would suggest that books with more reviews tend to have lower ratings
# If it is near O: It means there's no significant linear relationship between the number of reviews and the rating


# 6b create a scatter plot using seaborn sns.scatterplot(x='review_count', y='rating', data=df2)
# customizing the scatter plot can be done by adding (color='pink', marker='*') to the previous code
# it can be further customized by adding labels and regulating the figure size with the use of matplotlib.pyplot

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='review_count', y='rating', data=df2, color='pink', marker='*')

plt.title('Relationship Between Number of Reviews and Rating', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Number of Reviews', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Rating', fontsize=14)

plt.show()

#6c when examining both the correlation coefficient and the scatter plot you can see that here is no linear
# relationship between the number of reviews a book has and its average rating
# so, a book having more or fewer reviews doesn't consistently correlate with it being rated higher or lower
Code

## Exercise 7: Calculate the following descriptive statistics for the numerical features (e.g., number of reviews, average rating, etc.):
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Standard Deviation
  - Range
  - Create a histogram or box plot for at least one of the numerical features, highlighting any skewness or outliers.
    
### Python Tools: Use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib or seaborn for visualization.

# 7a testing the data type per column to help locate the numeric features
df2.dtypes

# 7a a new list was created with all the columns that have numerical values in the dataframe 
# "numerical_features = ['rating', 'review_count', 'year', 'rating_count']"
# to create a more readable print an f-string was used once again 
# in which "\n" is a line break

numerical_features = ['rating', 'review_count', 'year', 'rating_count']
mean_values = df2[numerical_features].mean()
median_values = df2[numerical_features].median()
std_values = df2[numerical_features].std()
range_values = df2[numerical_features].max() - df[numerical_features].min()

print(f"Mean values:\n{mean_values}\n")
print(f"Median values:\n{median_values}\n")
print(f"Standard Deviation:\n{std_values}\n")
print(f"Range:\n{range_values}\n")

# 7b created a histogram for 'rating' using "sns.histplot(df['rating'])"
# bins=20 was added to divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals
# a kernel density estimate was added "kde=True"
# labels are added with the use of matplotlib.pyplot

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['rating'], bins=20, kde=True, color='pink') 

plt.title('Histogram of Book Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# 7b created a boxplot for 'rating' using "sns.boxplot(x=df['rating'])"
# labels are added with the use of matplotlib.pyplot

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x=df['rating'], color='pink')

plt.title('Box Plot of Book Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.show()
